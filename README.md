## Machine Learning
| Project Link | Web App Link | Tools | Project Description |
|---|---|---|---|
|[Predict Accident Risk](https://github.com/HansikaGunasekara/accident-risk-predictor)🚦🚗|[Streamlit App](https://accident-risk-predictor-n32nsxbjtjfahgteq2tkvn.streamlit.app)|**Python<br> Sklearn<br> Pandas<br> Streamlit<br> Ensemble Learner Models<br>**|Developed & deployed a machine learning model pipeline to predict the accident risk level (0-1) for a given set of past reported accidents, road infrasturcuture & environmental conditions.<br><br> The regression model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (**RMSE**) of **0.05552** on the **unseen test set, showing strong predictive accuracy**. Since the road accident risk values range from 0 to 1, this low error indicates that the ML model’s predictions are very close to the true risk levels. Overall, the results demonstrate good generalization to new data.<br><br> The stakeholders would be the transport authorities & self-driving car manufacturers|

## Data Analytics
