### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
### It Begins with a Dream


**I am Hansika, a self-starter on AI Innovations, a best friend to my partner who works towards a healthy tommorow and a brave mum with two pearls. In 2023, the young family came to UK searching for opportunities. I have been recognized as a UK Global Talent Visa recipient. Although they do not know the context behind my research interests, my courageous parents who live in Sri Lanka are so proud about me as the first in the family to go this far. Unless my attraction to opportunities I would have been a typical Asian girl adjusting to the situation.**
